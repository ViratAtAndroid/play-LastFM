### by Abhishek Pathak

## Technologies and libraries used:
 - Proper MVVM architecture with Android Jetpack components
 - Dependency injection (DI) with Dagger 2
 - Kotlin extensions to convert and combine search results
 - Searches for tracks, artists and albums at the same time, asynchronously
 - Retrofit and okhttp for network communication
 - Coroutines for handling async service calls
 - Lifecycle and live data to pass search results to UI
 - androidx package for backward compatibility
 - Single activity app as suggested by Google
 - NavigationComponent
 - Timber for logging
